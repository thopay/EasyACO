<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/562041975797317643/770336160983023666/home.png?width=931&height=676">

EasyACO is a marketplace for sneaker botters to advertise slots for upcoming drops. When the average buyer isn't quick enough to buy shoes when they release, they usually have two options, get a bot or get a slot from someone who has a bot. Getting a bot can cost upwards of $5000 USD, whereas a slot can be as cheap as $10 per success. EasyACO was developed to be the go to source to find reliable and trusted slot providers. 

Accounts are authenticated and updated via Discord's Oauth system. From there, if someone was looking to apply to become a provider, they can fill out a form and admins will review and vet the applicant. If approved, the provider will be granted extra permissions across the site to post their offers. 

EasyACO utilizes SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL to establish a fully functional relational database. The site is served via Flask and uses Bootstrap for the UI.
